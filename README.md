# streamdeck-client-csharp
A C# client library for the Elgato Stream Deck device.

## What is this?
Elgato just released their [Official Stream Deck SDK](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/overview/), but it only supported Javascript, C++, and Objective-C.  I was frustrated as I prefer C# as my go-to language.  So, I wrote this wrapper to ease writing plugins.

## What's New
Added support for new Stream Deck+ SDK

## Breaking Changes

- `streamdeck_client_csharp` namespace has been changed to `StreamDeck.Client`.


## Requirements
This library uses the native WebSocket support found in Windows 8 & higher. This means that any application that uses this library must be running Windows 8 or higher.

## Current functionality
The library should support all features documented by the SDK:
- Connection and Disconnection
- Sending messages
- Receiving events

## Feature roadmap
At this point, we should only need to monitor the Official SDK for new features and implement them.

## How do I get started using it?
Download the NuGet package by searching for "streamdeck-client-csharp" or downloading it manually from https://www.nuget.org/packages/streamdeck-client-csharp.  If you clone the repository, you will see the TestPlugin C# project. When this is compiled it creates a folder in the output directory `com.tyren.testplugin.sdPlugin`.  If you copy this into your Stream Deck's [Plugin Folder](https://developer.elgato.com/documentation/stream-deck/sdk/create-your-own-plugin/), and launch Stream Deck, you should see the `C# Test Plugin` category show up with some test actions inside.

## I found a bug, who do I contact?
Just head over to the https://github.com/TyrenDe/streamdeck-client-csharp/issues page and create a new issue.
